# *shapechange* R Package

shapechange is an R package created to allow users to recreate the results obtained by Matthew M. Spencer in his paper titled 
*Size change, Shape change, and the growth space of a community*<sup>1</sup>. Spencer's paper 
proposed a new measure for the rate of shape change of a community. Using this package, users can calculate measures of change in size 
and shape of a community (respectively, proportional to among-species mean and standard deviation of mean proportional 
growth rates over some time interval). Size change is closely related to the Living Planet Index 
(see paper by Loh et al. 2005)<sup>2</sup>. In addition, users can calculate and plot other measures of change 
in communities, such as those proposed by Foster and Tilman<sup>3</sup>, Jassby and Goldman<sup>4</sup>, and Bray-Curtis<sup>5</sup>.
